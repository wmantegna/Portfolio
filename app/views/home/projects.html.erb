		    <p>GrowShare.net is a website where users can view vacant lots in Philadelphia, collaborate on ideas for how to put the land to meaningful use, and exchange resources within the community to get more out of resources already available within the community (capital, human, or land). My role in this project was focused on business analysis & design.</p>

				<p>We entered this project into the <a href="http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2013/02/google-places-api-developer-challenge.html"><b>Google Places API Developers Challenge</b></a> in January 2013, and placed in the <b>Runners Up</b> category (top 5). Out of the 87 teams (from 27 countries), we were the only group of University students to enter.</p>
